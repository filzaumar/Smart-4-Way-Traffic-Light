# Smart-4-Way-Traffic-Light
## Overview
This project presents a smart traffic light controller designed to optimize traffic flow at intersections using real-time vehicle detection. The system employs IR sensors, Timer 555 ICs, multiplexers, and D-flip flops to dynamically adjust traffic signals based on current traffic conditions, reducing congestion and improving safety.

## Features
- Real-time vehicle detection with IR sensors
- Dynamic traffic light control using digital logic circuits
- State machine implementation with D-flip flops and multiplexers
- Timer 555 for timing control of signal changes
- Simulation in Proteus and successful hardware implementation

## Components Used
- IR Sensors  
- Timer 555 IC  
- Multiplexer (MUX)
